About Hide Top Bar
------------------

This GNOME extension helps to hide GNOME's top bar when it gets into your way.

In the extension's preferences, different behaviors can be specified: unhiding on mouse-over or on pressing a keyboard shortcut, or when no window requires the space.

Installation from extensions.gnome.org
--------------------------------------

Unless you are on Debian or Ubuntu (see section below), the recommended way of installing Hide Top Bar is via the official builds on
[extensions.gnome.org/.../hide-top-bar/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/545/hide-top-bar/).

If you're installing via a Chrome browser, make sure you read the
[GNOME Shell integration for Chrome Installation Guide](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShellIntegrationForChrome/Installation).


[Debian](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/gnome-shell-extension-autohidetopbar)
------

If you are using a Debian based distribution, the preferred installation method is to use
the packaged version. By this, compatibility problems caused by different gnome-shell versions in
your distribution can be avoided. You can install the package with:

    sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-autohidetopbar

If you find problems with the _Debian packaged version_, please file bugs at
the [Debian Bugtracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting).

Installation from source
------------------------

If you insist on installing from source, the commands `xgettext` and `msgfmt`
from the `gettext` package (package name may vary depending on your
distribution) are required.

The procedure to install from source is as follows: Check out the source code into your local
extensions directory, compile by running `make`, install and restart GNOME Shell. For example:

    cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
    git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/tuxor1337/hidetopbar.git hidetopbar@mathieu.bidon.ca
    cd hidetopbar@mathieu.bidon.ca
    make
    cd ..
    gnome-extensions enable hidetopbar@mathieu.bidon.ca

You might need to log off and on again for the install procedure to take effect. Alternatively, you may want
to try one of the following:

    # If you are running a X11 session run the following command
    gnome-shell --replace &
    # If you are running a wayland session run the following command
    dbus-run-session -- gnome-shell --nested --wayland

Updating the language strings
-----------------------------

Whenever you notice that there are localizable strings in Hide Top Bar that are not
covered by the strings in `./locale/`, you can regenerate the `*.pot`-file using the
following command:

    make ./locale/hidetopbar.pot

To then incorporate the changes to the actual translation files for each language,
run one of the following commands:

    make all-po                                 # For updating the files for all languages
    make ./locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/hidetopbar.po  # For updating one specific po file, where 'XX' is the language code

As mentioned in the previous section, running `make` requires the `gettext` package
to be installed (the package names may vary depending on your distribution).

Troubleshooting
---------------

### Can I assign a shortcut to temporally disable the autohiding altogether?

Follow the [instructions to assign a system-wide shortcut that disables/enables the extension](https://gitlab.gnome.org/tuxor1337/hidetopbar/issues/43#issuecomment-796583424).

### Notification pop-ups cause the top bar to hide.

Using the extension [Panel OSD](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/708/panel-osd/), you can configure notification pop-ups to show up in a different position (e.g. a few pixels down) where they won't overlap with the top bar.

### The panel overlaps with the dash/dock.

This is an issue of the extension [Dash to Dock](https://github.com/micheleg/dash-to-dock), see also [this comment](https://github.com/tuxor1337/hidetopbar/issues/149#issuecomment-964419677).
